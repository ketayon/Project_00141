0	"The app and the watch often get disconnected, even after replacing with new one faced same issue. Hence notifications do not land on watch. Some serious technical issue??? Otherwise,looks wise and all other features are good but it makes no sense to buy, when the most important feature is not working properly. For every 30 to 40 mins I have to open the app to connect, and then again switch off and on 'allow notification ' then it works for few mins..... Thanks to Amazon,they are refunding my money"

I.e you can go one step forward in any menu but if you choose wrong option you have to start again.Second thing when i am pairing with my one plus mobile it get auto connect for some time, but soon the fastag application is failed to detect watch, even the phone is showing that watch is paired. In this situation i have to inpair watch then pair again. Its sad!")(1, "If you're in the market for a new smartwatch, then look no further than the Fastrack New Limitless FS1 Smart Watch.  I've had the chance to test out this product for a while now, and I have to say, I'm thoroughly impressed.First of all, let's talk about the display. The biggest 1.95\" Horizon Curve Display is simply stunning. It's crystal clear and easy to read, even in bright sunlight. And the fact that it's a curved display means that you get an even better viewing experience.The watch also features SingleSync BT Calling v5.3, which means that you can take calls and talk to people directly from your wrist. It's incredibly convenient, and I love not having to take my phone out of my pocket every time I receive a call.Another fantastic feature is the built-in Alexa. With Alexa, you can ask for the weather, set reminders, and even control your smart home devices, all with just your voice. It's a great addition that makes the Fastrack New Limitless FS1 Smart Watch even more useful.And let's not forget about the battery life. With a mega 7-day battery, you won't have to worry about constantly charging your watch. This is especially important if you're someone who's always on the go and doesn't have time to charge their devices constantly.The ATS Chipset with Zero Lag is also a standout feature. The watch runs smoothly and quickly, and I've never experienced any lag or delays.With over 100 sports modes and 150+ watchfaces, the Fastrack New Limitless FS1 Smart Watch has something for everyone. Whether you're a runner, swimmer, or weightlifter, you'll find a sports mode that suits your needs.
