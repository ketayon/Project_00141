{1: 'I needed to upgrade from my iPhone 6S but didn’t want to spend a fortune so found a ‘Good’ refurbished iPhone 12 via BackMarket within my self imposed budget. The online buying process was easy.'}
{1: 'I ordered the iPhone 12 mini in an excellent condition and it came exactly how I expected it too, was a little smaller than I’d imagined but it is a mini so can’t complain 😂 definitely recommend back market to anyone who considers buying a new and refurbished phone, it came as if I ordered a brand new phone from apple itself. Definitely will be using back market in the future. Thanks x'}
{1: 'I ordered the purple iPhone 12 mini for my wife at a very reasonable price having read the reviews first. Having read them I was fairly convinced I was doing the right thing and so was pleasantly surprised to find that the "good" condition was in fact almost perfect, in fact I couldn\'t find anything wrong with it at all. The phone arrived exactly on time and my wife is so very pleased with it. This transaction has also convinced me that buying refurbished from Back Market is the way I will go when I come to the point of renewing my own phone in a couple of years time. Excellent service and quality goods.'}
{1: "I ordered an iphone 12 mini in excellent condition and it's perfect. Battery was 100% too. My order arrived promptly. Very happy. I would only buy refurbished tech as it's the same as brand new but cheaper and more sustainable."}
{1: "I have never used Back Market before - however I'm used to buying second hand and refurbished phones, being fully aware of the benefits and occasional pitfalls\nI ordered an iPhone 12 Mini in Excellent condition for my partner.\nThe experience was quick and effortless.\nI paid extra for expedited delivery, which was as rapid as could be expected - next day as promised. Shipped by Phones Direct\nThe Quality of the phone was at least as described if not better - as good as new - not a single mark or blemish that I can see.\nMy partner is delighted - the phone is better than she (we) had hoped.\nI'll be in the market for a new phone soon - and will definitely buy from Back Market."}
{1: "My daughter told me about Back Market when I needed a new iPhone.\nHighly delighted to find a model  (iPhone 12 mini) that met my needs at a price I could afford. I ordered it and it arrived promptly.\nI think I'd say it's in better condition than I expected - pleasing.\nAside from the obvious cost savings involved in buying a refurbished phone, another attraction to BackMarket is their mission and raison d'etre of keeping stuff out of landfill and making restored devices a natural go-to."}
{1: 'Fast, friendly, reassuring to have this contact when (nervously) buying a reconditioned mobile.\nI’m still getting used to it after previously having an iPhone 5! But seems fine and I’m really pleased.'}
{1: 'Got this phone for my dad, upgrade from iPhone 8. Very happy with the condition of the phone, could not see any scratches or marks on the phone (got in excellent condition). Only issue my dad brought up was the phone battery not lasting the whole day, not sure if that is just how iPhones are or if it is because of the phone being refurbished. In any case, very happy with the purchase!'}
{1: 'I ordered an iPhone 13 in excellent condition. I received it in the right amount of time and in really good condition a couple of minus scratches I can barely see. The battery iPhone if more than excellent for a refurbished phone, it was at 97%. I will highly recommend and will considère to buy my next phones in this website.'}
{1: 'Very happy with my new iPhone. Opted for good condition. Quite a few small silver marks on the sides of the phone, but it was going into a case so these aren’t seen anyway. Battery quality showing at 89%. Screen in perfect condition. All works perfectly, and for the price I paid I am very happy. Would definitely buy a refurbished iPhone again, and have recommended to family members who are looking to upgrade their phones too.'}
{1: 'Great quality product and received it on time. Had to purchase a new phone due to mine being stolen so I bought the same model and this was the best price for the condition and the storage capacity compared to all other refurbished sites.'}
{1: 'was the best decision I have ever made. My son loves it it was in mint condition exactly what I was expecting, and it was delivered within 2 working days ordered it on Saturday, but the shop did not open until Monday received it on the Tuesday afternoon. I will definitely order from them again and save a lot of money buying second-hand or refurbished'}
{1: 'Unexpected quality- to be honest I was skeptical when I ordered and thought it wouldn’t be as good as it is! Honestly couldn’t tell it was refurbished. Only thing is it doesn’t like being attached to an external music player but not sure if that’s the phone or the system so not really worried'}
{1: "I would recommend this site to anyone looking to purchase a refurbished item. In fact, I already have multiple times.\nThe phone I order is in excellent condition and, whilst a little bit of battery decay is always expected, I've gone from a phone that required multiple charges a day to a phone which requires one.\nIf you're thinking of buying something, do."}
{1: 'Would definitely recommend buying a refurbished phone from back market because my phone has come and it is basically brand new! 100% battery health, not a single scratch and everything works perfectly! Fast delivery and feels like better than buying a brand new phone for the environment. And back market prices are the best i’ve seen anywhere so definitely getting the best deal out there'}
{1: 'AMAZING!! I ordered the iPhone 14 pro Max on a bank holiday Monday so I was expecting delivery to take a little longer than usual however it was delivered by Wednesday morning so almost next day! I have never had a refurbished phone before as I’ve always been a bit dubious about buying them but I don’t have a bad word to say. Product was delivered in a secure box with a charging lead, and the phone looked brand new and saved me a couple of hundred pounds. SO IMPRESSED WILL DEFINITELY USE BACK MARKET IN THE FUTURE'}
{1: 'I was disappointed to find a scratch in the screen of my iPhone 14 pro max\nI spent the extra to get the ‘excellent’ condition. I didn’t report it though as needed the use of the phone, so perhaps they would have sorted it!'}
{1: 'So happy with my new phone, I purchased an ‘excellent’ condition and it really is! No issues at all with the phone itself or any of the set up. Really happy to have discovered this site & have already recommended to friends!'}
{1: "At first I was sceptical about buying from back market I thought the quality wouldn't be so great but the phone was in pristine new condition and works perfectly. Will always buy from here. Thank you very much."}
{1: 'I’ve been excited for this to arrive since I’ve ordered it. It finally came today and as soon as I opened the box I was in disbelief. For a renewed phone the quality was amazing, it’s literally the same as a brand new phone. Anyone who is looking at buying this, go for it as it’s the best purchase I’ve ever made.'}
{1: 'Like everyone else, i was feeling shady about the website but once i got my delivery and saw the product i was like wowed to the fullest.\nLove the product, the delivery is super-speedy, though for an excellent condition i expected about 99/100% battery health but got 97. Also, minor screen scratches. So, a lil disappointed there.\nBut overall back market rocks, will definitely recommend to others.\nThanks'}
{1: 'I couldn’t be pleased enough with my iPhone. You could have said it was a new one and I wouldn’t have known any difference.\nI can’t fault your service, and the delivery was very quick.\nI definitely recommend people to get in touch with Back Market.'}
{1: 'The phone was impeccable. As good as new and much better value. Great service, easy to use website. Plus feeling so much better for getting a refurbished phone, as it’s better for the planet. I also sold my old phone, so feeling mich better about upgrading (though my old one was 5 year old).'}
{1: 'Everythings works and look amazingly like out of the box.\nGot a tiny scratch on the side(maybe damage of falling)\nCamera okay speaker good\nCondition 9/10 (-1 because of just one hairline of a scratch)\nOverall performance 100%\nNot even feels like refurbished/used\nI pick the lowest possibly pricing out of all for this 14'}
{1: 'Phone arrived quickly, in an Apple box & looked like new ! Had a couple of glitches with the phone when transferring everything but after turning off & on again, it sorted itself out. Since then, have been very happy with my iPhone 14 !  Would definitely purchase from Back market again.'}
{1: 'I am beyond impressed. Ordered it yesterday and it arrived early this morning. I purchased the iPhone 14 and there’s not one scratch in sight or signs of use, still Apple Warranty and battery health is at 100%. Saved myself £250 from ordering it here. Bargain.'}
{1: 'I ordered and iPhone 14 in excellent co during as it was cheaper than the good condition though Mazuma it arrive in 2 days. Battery health 100%\nThe phone is immaculate came in an ordinary box packed well with a free charging cable.\nDaughter bough the same phone through the same seller and she is more than delighted.\nWill definitely be using Back Market for all my tech.'}
{1: 'Super quick delivery, I got an iPhone 14 and the battery was at 100% so very happy with that. The only thing I would say is that I chose excellent condition and the cameras were a bit dirty around the rim - I would’ve expected the phone to be spot clean from choosing excellent condition. Also customer service is a little bit slow to reply to emails. But other than that very happy with my experience overall and would buy from there again!'}
{1: 'My experience with backmarket was great. Their website is really simple to navigate, they have access to a great selection of phones at really reasonable prices, and ordering was easy. The phone I ordered turned up very quickly, and turned up as described - a black unlocked iPhone 14 128GB in excellent condition. Cosmetically it’s near perfect, and the battery health is 100%, which is what I expected with such a recent model of phone. Top stuff!'}
{1: "this is one of the best purchases i’ve ever made and from opening my package (which arrived next day by the way!) you wouldn’t have a clue that it was refurbished whatsoever! it came in the original box, with a satisfying peel off of the protective tape on the airpods case, it also came with the airpods case charger! bonus! and there were absolutely no scratches, no issues whatsoever and they were a dream to pair up to my iphone! i’m incredibly happy, they even came with each size ear tip so that you can find your perfect fit! i’m so delighted to have been given such a brilliant condition product and considering it was considered 'very good condition', i’d have worded it as 'perfect condition' in my eyes! i have 0 complaints and i cannot thank the seller & backmarket enough!"}

{0: "Although the phone initially arrived in good condition, at a modest cost, it completely opened up on the left-hand side, for no reason, in just over two months. The screen was separated from the body of the phone! I tried to make use of the warranty, but the promised timeframe was not respected at all (I still haven't got it back), and I was told that I wasn't eligible because of a shock - which never happened - 'proven' by a small chip on the opposite side of the screen. So I wouldn't recommend the platform to anyone for purchases as essential as phones."}

{0: 'Wrong envelope delivered, return label incorrectly addressed, then no refund because the shipment is allegedly incomplete. Absolutely poor service'}
